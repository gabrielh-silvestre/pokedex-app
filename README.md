# Pokedex

I started this project to practice and understand how data fetch is done in React.
Today I continue developing it to transform it into a _"real world"_ Pokedex, which I can use as a support tool while I _(or other people)_ play the pokemon games.

## Overview

### The challenge

1. First version of the Pokedex should
- Render Pokemons dynamically
- Search pokemons by name or id
- Adapt mobile and desktop screens

2. Actual and future versions should
- Have pages containing detailed information about pokemons, items, ability, combos, etc _in construction_

## My process

### Built with

- React
- React-hooks
- React-Routers
- Redux (RTK)
- Pokenode-ts
- TypeScript
- Tailwind
- Tailwind-Styled-Components

### What I Learned

I started this project to learn about API consuming on React, using class components, JavaScript and Tailwind for styling. In the beginning I learned about life-cycle methods, state management, prop typing with PropTypes and Tailwind CSS _(was my first contact with the framework)_.

Today I use this project to practice general Front-end tools, like Redux, Styled-Components, custom Hooks, TypeScript, etc.

### Continued development

My goal with this project it's to make it a helpfull tool for Pokemon games, containing info about pokemons, items, berrys, routes and moves.

### Useful resources
